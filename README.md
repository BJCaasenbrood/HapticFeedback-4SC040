# How to install/run the HapticFeedback MATLAB code

1) Download the .zip under the option *Code* above.
2) Unzip the file at a desired location.
3) run the 'main.m' to run the code.
4) Change the simulink model 'mainModel.slx' in the /src folder if needed. Don't change the mainModel.slxc in the main folder, this file will be automatically compiled by MATLAB and does not need any changes.

That's it. If there are any questions, mail to b.j.caasenbrood@tue.nl
