# How to install/run the HapticFeedback MATLAB code

1) Download the .zip under the option *Code* above.
2) Unzip the file at a desired location.
3) run the 'main.m' to run the code.
4) Change the SIMULINK model 'mainModel.slx' in the /src folder if needed. Don't change the mainModel.slxc, this file is automatically compiled by MATLAB and contains a compiled version of the SIMULINK model.

That's it. If there are any questions, mail to b.j.caasenbrood@tue.nl
